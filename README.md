There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for each heading. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

## Heading ##
  > Media Drag and Drop to Browser and Video transcoder using FFMPEG.


## Sub-Heading ##
  > Anyone who would like to modify their local video content to a different format for either viewing on a different device or for embedding in an application, will find this useful.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  > This product is a easy to use GUI-browser based video transcoder for files located on your local device.

## Problem ##
  > Currently, viewing a video file which is on the local device will require a media player. This will require you to either manually install a media player or use the existing player on the device, which may not always be a good choice. 

## Solution ##
  > A simple drag a drop of the video file to your browser should solve the problem of finding the media player to play it on.
  > Transcoding the content is done by selecting the various options available on the menu. And, finally saving the new video file is made possible with a single click on 'Save' button.

## Quote from You ##
  > "This is the easiest product to use without having a media player and installing a separate video transcoder to modify existing video content to your needs."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Simply drag your media file onto the dotted box on the browser window. Once loading is complete, play it to make sure that it is the right content you are looking for.
  > Edit as per your requirements with the various options available on the menu.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  > "This was the most easy to use product for my video transcoding needs by just dragging and dropping my files to the browser and transcoding them. Saves a lot of hassel of having a GUI for video transcoder installed."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  > Click on save file to save the updated, new video file. All done, use the new saved file however you would like to!
